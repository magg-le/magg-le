<h1> :man_dancing:Hi, I'm Mike!:man_dancing: </h1>

<p> I'm a CS student currently studying at Boston University. I've got previous first-hand experience in web development, but I find a lot of interest in math and CS theory. 
Other than studying, I've worked front-end development at Nynth Labs, a digital marketing agency. I'm currently a course assistant for one of the introductory CS logic courses at BU.
I'm very open to collaborating with anyone, so don't be afraid to say hi! </p>
