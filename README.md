<h1> Hello! </h1>

<p> I'm Mike, a developer and researcher interested in the theory and applications of computability and machine learning. I've mostly built proficiencies in React.js (by working on https://mikelott.net) and PyTorch through personal projects.
I love teaching computer science and associated STEM topics, and was recently a teaching assistant for the discrete mathematics course at Boston University. </p>
